        <p>Mars is the 4th planet from the sun (and also the 5th route on this site). It was named after the Roman god of war. It is commonly referred to as the Red Planet due to it's color, and signs of life have been discovered on the planet recently. Many believe Mars could potentially be colonized at some point, and Mars is even home to a Looney Tunes character named Marvin.</p>
